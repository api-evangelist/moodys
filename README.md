# Moodys
This is the repo for managing the profile of the Moody's API for the [APIs.io search engine](https://apis.io/). Each API profiled will be added to [the APIs.json index](apis.yml) and include OpenAPI, Postman Collections, or any other artifacts. Leave an issue here if you have any questions and [visit API Evangelist for more information of the profiling and review of APIs](https://apievangelist.com/services/)â€”I am happy to transfer this repository to the APIs owner to make the listing authoritative.
