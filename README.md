# Moodys
This is the repo for managing the profiling of the Moody's API--each API will be added to the APIs.json index and include OpenAPI, and any other artifacts. Leave an issue if you have any questions and [visit API Evangelist for more information of the profiling and review of APIs](https://apievangelist.com/services/).
